# GoreeCloud AI

GoreeCloud AI is GoreeCloud's first-party AI application and local-model experience. It is designed around Glaze UI, integrates with Ollama as an initial replaceable model-runtime foundation, and uses GoreeCloud platform services rather than exposing infrastructure as the product identity.

## Current source milestone

This repository now includes the first executable **Wardveil Security artifact-intake boundary** for GoreeCloud AI.

`reference/ai_artifact_security.py` provides a fail-closed staging-release gate for:

- chat uploads;
- knowledge documents;
- imported assets;
- model artifacts;
- tool artifacts; and
- generated files.

Artifacts remain in private application staging until Wardveil Scan returns current authoritative clean evidence bound to the exact GoreeCloud AI resource identity and SHA-256 digest. The staged file is hashed again after verification and before release so changed bytes cannot inherit an earlier clean finding.

Suspicious content is held. Malicious content is blocked and can request an explicitly authorized Wardveil Quarantine handoff. Unknown, unsupported, stale, expired-clean, mismatched, non-authoritative, malformed, or scanner-unavailable evidence fails closed.

GoreeCloud AI **does not connect directly to ClamAV**. ClamAV remains replaceable malware-scanning infrastructure behind Wardveil Security.

A clean malware scan is also **not permission to execute or load active artifacts**. Model loading, tool execution, generated code execution, deserialization, and other active operations retain separate runtime-policy and sandbox requirements.

See [`docs/WARDVEIL_ARTIFACT_SECURITY.md`](docs/WARDVEIL_ARTIFACT_SECURITY.md) and [`contracts/wardveil.ai-artifact-scan.json`](contracts/wardveil.ai-artifact-scan.json).

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/test_ai_artifact_security.py
python3 scripts/validate_wardveil_ai_integration.py
```

The source integration is not a production malware-protection claim. Deployed authenticated AI-to-Wardveil transport, live scanner/signature health, real application adapters, quarantine execution, Glaze UI states, Privacy Shield acceptance, and active-artifact runtime policy still require target-environment evidence before production acceptance.
