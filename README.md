## Product boundary

GoreeCloud AI is an original first-party GoreeCloud application rather than a reskinned third-party AI interface. The intended permanent component relationship is:

- **GoreeCloud AI** — conversations, Workspaces, knowledge/RAG, files, tools, agents, artifacts, research orchestration, application authorization, model-role selection, and the user-facing product.
- **Ollama** — replaceable local model-execution runtime.
- **GoreeCloud Search** — first-party current-information and Internet-research provider.
- **GoreeCloud Identity** — authenticated identity, sessions, credentials, and approved identity claims; GoreeCloud AI still owns application authorization/data-access decisions.
- **Wardveil Security** — protection, trust, scanning, policy, verification, and response boundaries.
- **Privacy Shield** — privacy, consent, purpose, data-use, and minimization authority.
- **Everkeep** — backup, restore, recovery, preservation, portability, succession, and continuity authority.
- **GoreeCloud Mesh** — cross-system coordination, governance, and evidence transport.
- **Glaze UI** — visual, interaction, accessibility, responsive, and design-system authority.

Open WebUI, AnythingLLM, SearXNG, individual model names, and individual scanner engines are replacement targets/infrastructure rather than permanent product boundaries.

## Current implementation

The repository includes:

- React + TypeScript + Vite client and responsive conversation shell.
- Backend-owned Ollama discovery and streaming NDJSON chat with cancellation, timeout, and upstream failure isolation.
- Stable GoreeCloud model-role abstraction mapped to replaceable installed Ollama models.
- Persistent conversations with rename, delete, edit/resubmit, regeneration, branching, and lineage metadata.
- Native Workspaces with instructions, default model role, file references, knowledge/tool placeholders, and research preferences.
- Private attachment staging, restrictive permissions, SHA-256 binding, quotas, storage usage, deletion, and Workspace reference reconciliation.
- Node-native Wardveil artifact trust gate with exact resource/digest binding, fail-closed unavailable/unknown behavior, and non-destructive quarantine handoff state.
- Passive post-Wardveil text extraction for released UTF-8 text, Markdown, and JSON with source-digest revalidation and private derived records.
- Read-only knowledge-eligibility assessment that never authorizes indexing, retrieval, or model context.
- Bounded non-persistent knowledge-authorization assessment for supplied GoreeCloud Identity/application context plus the current Privacy Shield decision contract.
- Strict resource, operation, actor, request, processing-zone, destination, obligation, decision-expiration, and optional request-retention-expiration validation with Privacy Shield `DENY`/`REQUIRE_USER_DECISION` semantics preserved.
- Explicit source-trust boundary: supplied authorization JSON is not production-trusted, creates no durable authorization, and cannot execute a knowledge stage while authenticated adapters are absent.
- Independent Python Wardveil artifact-intake reference contract and validation suite.
- Opt-in live runtime validator for first-party service health/model discovery and optional streamed Ollama chat through the GoreeCloud AI backend.

The current development server deliberately has no fabricated Wardveil scanner transport. Default uploads therefore remain private/staged and `unverified`; they cannot enter text extraction or AI context.

Clients do not connect directly to Ollama or ClamAV.

## Attachment trust and extraction

Upload flow:

```text
untrusted bytes
  -> private staging
  -> SHA-256 binding
  -> Wardveil Scan decision contract
  -> evidence validation
  -> post-scan SHA-256 recheck
  -> released OR retained staged
```

`server/artifact-security.mjs` enforces the native trust transition. Unknown, unsupported, stale, expired, malformed, mismatched, non-authoritative, or scanner-unavailable evidence fails closed. Suspicious content is held. Malicious content is blocked and can produce a non-destructive quarantine handoff request that still requires separate executor authority.

A clean malware result is not permission to execute code, load models, run tools, deserialize unsafe content, or publish data.

### Passive text extraction

`POST /api/files/:id/extraction` is a separate post-release gate. It accepts only attachments that are `available`, stored in `released` state, and whose Wardveil decision allows release/context-oriented use.

Before parsing, the released bytes are re-hashed and must still match the accepted attachment digest. Initial media types are `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `text/x-markdown`, and `application/json`. Fatal UTF-8 decoding, unsupported-control rejection, JSON validation, and `MAX_TEXT_EXTRACTION_BYTES` apply. Extracted text remains private application data bound to source/content SHA-256 digests.

Extraction is not chunking, embedding, indexing, retrieval, RAG eligibility, model-context authorization, Privacy Shield authorization, or external-processing permission.

## Knowledge gate observation and authorization assessment

`GET /api/files/:id/knowledge-eligibility` reports current Wardveil, extraction, Identity/application, Privacy Shield, indexing, retrieval, and model-context gate state without creating or advancing any stage.

`POST /api/files/:id/knowledge-authorization-assessment` additionally accepts bounded authorization inputs for one application-local operation:

- `goreecloud-ai.knowledge.index`
- `goreecloud-ai.knowledge.retrieve`
- `goreecloud-ai.knowledge.model-context`

These are GoreeCloud AI application-local operation identifiers. They are not new central GoreeCloud Identity scopes and are not additions to the canonical Privacy Shield capability registry.

The Identity input must bind an authenticated actor, valid observation/expiry window, exact attachment resource ID, and GoreeCloud AI application permission. Privacy input is structurally aligned to the current Privacy Shield decision contract and checks request/decision binding, resource, operation, requester/acting user, processing zone, destination, permitted operations, obligations, decision expiration, and optional request-retention expiration. A malformed optional request-retention expiration fails closed.

Privacy Shield `DENY` blocks; `REQUIRE_USER_DECISION` remains pending; `ALLOW`/`ALLOW_WITH_CONSTRAINTS` can only become structurally satisfied when checked bindings agree.

Crucially, a structurally satisfied assessment still returns:

- `sourceTrust.productionTrustedInput: false`
- `persistentAuthorizationCreated: false`
- `executionAuthorized: false`
- `eligibleForIndexing: false`
- `eligibleForRetrieval: false`
- `eligibleForModelContext: false`

Authenticated GoreeCloud Identity/Privacy Shield adapters, operation-bound capability/signature verification, durable decision/evidence state, revocation/replay handling, and actual indexing/retrieval/model-context implementation remain absent. A client-supplied JSON object cannot manufacture production authority.

See `docs/KNOWLEDGE-AUTHORIZATION.md`, `docs/WARDVEIL_ARTIFACT_SECURITY.md`, and `docs/ATTACHMENT_LIFECYCLE.md`.

## API foundation

```text
GET    /api/health
GET    /api/ollama/models
POST   /api/ollama/chat

GET    /api/conversations
POST   /api/conversations
GET    /api/conversations/:id
PATCH  /api/conversations/:id
DELETE /api/conversations/:id

GET    /api/workspaces
POST   /api/workspaces
GET    /api/workspaces/:id
PATCH  /api/workspaces/:id
DELETE /api/workspaces/:id

GET    /api/files
POST   /api/files
GET    /api/files/:id
DELETE /api/files/:id
POST   /api/files/:id/extraction
GET    /api/files/:id/extraction
GET    /api/files/:id/knowledge-eligibility
POST   /api/files/:id/knowledge-authorization-assessment
```

The current JSON/local-file adapters are development persistence boundaries, not the final multi-user database design.

## Model roles

GoreeCloud AI presents stable functional roles while keeping individual model implementations replaceable:

| GoreeCloud role | Intended function | Initial candidate family |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GoreeCloud Assistant | General conversation and assistance | Qwen 3.5 |
| GoreeCloud Reasoner | Complex reasoning, architecture, and research | GPT-OSS |
| GoreeCloud Engineer | Infrastructure engineering, coding, and configuration | Qwen3-Coder |
| GoreeCloud Utility | Lightweight and recurring AI processing | Qwen3 |
| GoreeCloud Embeddings | Semantic retrieval and future RAG indexing | Qwen3-Embedding |
| GoreeCloud Vision | Optional specialized visual analysis | Gemma-family candidate |
| GoreeCloud Second Opinion | Optional independent reasoning/validation | DeepSeek-R1-family candidate |

Candidate models are not permanent dependencies.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8787` | Local backend port. |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Ollama address visible to the backend. |
| `GOREECLOUD_AI_API_TOKEN` | unset | Optional development direct-API bearer; not final Identity/application authorization. |
| `GOREECLOUD_AI_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Local private persistence/staging/released/extraction root. |
| `MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `1000000` | Maximum JSON request body, including authorization assessment input. |
| `MAX_FILE_BYTES` | `26214400` | Maximum attachment size. |
| `MAX_FILE_COUNT` | `1000` | Development attachment-record limit. |
| `MAX_TOTAL_FILE_BYTES` | `1073741824` | Development aggregate attachment limit. |
| `MAX_TEXT_EXTRACTION_BYTES` | `2097152` | Maximum source bytes accepted by passive extraction. |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Ollama upstream timeout. |

## Local development and validation

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run check
npm run check:server
npm run test:server
npm run build
python3 scripts/test_ai_artifact_security.py
python3 scripts/validate_wardveil_ai_integration.py
```

`npm run check:server` syntax-checks the authorization, eligibility, runtime-validator, and server modules. Native tests cover Wardveil trust/lifecycle, extraction, quotas/deletion, authorization input binding, Privacy Shield outcomes, and proof that knowledge authorization assessment remains non-executable.

### Live application/runtime validation

```bash
GOREECLOUD_AI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run validate:runtime
```

The base validation requires GoreeCloud AI health and Ollama model discovery through the application backend. `VALIDATE_OLLAMA_MODEL='<installed-model-id>'` can exercise one streamed model request. `VALIDATE_REQUIRE_WARDVEIL_SCANNER=true` fails if an environment expected to have an authenticated Wardveil transport reports it unconfigured.

Successful source checks or runtime validation do not establish Wardveil/Privacy Shield/Everkeep/Identity/Mesh production acceptance, recoverability, exact Glaze UI conformance, deployment readiness, or Stable qualification.

## Platform-system acceptance

- **Glaze UI:** the current authoritative Stable consumer target is **GLAZE UI V1.1 / 1.1.0**. GoreeCloud AI remains migration/reconciliation-required until exact-revision product-specific conformance evidence exists. Existing 2.x-labeled source is historical migration input and is not current conformance evidence.
- **Wardveil Security:** source trust enforcement exists; deployed authenticated Scan transport and AI consumer production acceptance remain pending.
- **Privacy Shield:** current decision fields/outcomes are structurally consumed, but authenticated runtime enforcement/capability/evidence and AI consumer acceptance remain pending. Supplied JSON cannot create Privacy Shield authority.
- **Everkeep:** attachment/extraction/future knowledge retention, export, backup, restore, recovery, preservation, portability, and succession remain pending application-specific acceptance.
- **GoreeCloud Identity:** Identity establishes authenticated identity/claims while GoreeCloud AI owns application authorization. Current assessment consumes supplied context but authenticated production Identity/session integration and durable multi-user boundaries remain pending.
- **GoreeCloud Mesh:** cross-system capability/evidence coordination remains pending.

## Roadmap

1. Execute and record live application-to-Ollama validation in the intended environment.
2. Implement authenticated GoreeCloud AI-to-Wardveil Scan transport and controlled clean/malicious/unavailable acceptance.
3. Implement authenticated GoreeCloud Identity sessions/service identities plus GoreeCloud AI resource/Workspace authorization.
4. Implement authenticated Privacy Shield PEP/PDP/capability/evidence integration for knowledge operations.
5. Reconcile and migrate the application to GLAZE UI V1.1 / 1.1.0 and collect exact consumer conformance evidence.
6. Add separately reviewed parsers/provenance only where security/privacy boundaries are defined.
7. Implement chunking, embeddings, indexing, retrieval, citations, and native RAG only after authoritative Identity/application/Privacy gates exist.
8. Integrate GoreeCloud Search for current-information research.
9. Add Wardveil-governed tools and agents.
10. Implement Everkeep export, backup, restore, retention, portability, and continuity for application/derived state.
11. Connect GoreeCloud Mesh contracts and broader first-party interoperability.
12. Complete runtime/interaction tests, deployment, monitoring, and production-readiness evidence.
