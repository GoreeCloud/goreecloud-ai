# GoreeCloud AI — Implemented Features

**Authority:** Repository-native implemented-feature record  
**Lifecycle:** Development / Draft / nonconformant  
**Production status:** Not production-ready or Stable-qualified

This file records capabilities that exist in the current repository source. An entry here does not by itself prove deployment, target-environment interoperability, production acceptance, or Stable qualification. Those states require their own exact-revision evidence.

## Application foundation

- React/TypeScript/Vite client with a responsive conversation shell, navigation and context surfaces.
- Node.js application backend bound to the local application boundary.
- Backend-owned local model discovery and streamed NDJSON chat through the replaceable local model runtime.
- Persistent conversations with rename, delete, edit/resubmit, regeneration, branching and branch lineage.
- Native Workspaces with instructions, default model role, file references, knowledge/tool placeholders and research preferences.

## Model routing and Development validation

- Stable GoreeCloud model-role abstraction over replaceable installed models.
- Side-effect-free approved selector covering the 13 planned functional roles.
- Bounded Development preflight that requires backend-supplied policy and model-discovery adapters and fails closed on invalid, stale, unavailable, timed-out or cancelled inputs.
- Restrictive protected local policy-file reader and literal-loopback-only installed-model discovery adapter.
- Explicit opt-in read-only model-routing diagnostic that never invokes inference.
- Pure operator-declared model capability/resource-fit candidate assessment covering role/model binding, modalities, tool-use declaration, context budget, estimated memory/reserve and concurrency headroom.
- Explicit opt-in local resource diagnostic that composes protected policy/profile input, loopback inventory and free **system RAM** sampling. It does not measure GPU VRAM or establish real model capability.
- Opt-in baseline live runtime validator for application health, application-backed model discovery and an explicitly selected streamed request.
- Opt-in approved-model runtime validator that binds one exact local Development request to a protected approval policy and exact application-backed installed-model discovery, executes one streamed request through the existing backend and emits sanitized evidence without generated text or credentials. This is Development evidence only; it does not authorize production inference.

## File, trust and knowledge foundations

- Private attachment staging with restrictive permissions, SHA-256 binding, metadata, quotas, aggregate storage limits, deletion and Workspace-reference reconciliation.
- Node-native Wardveil artifact trust gate with resource/digest binding, fail-closed unavailable/unknown handling and non-destructive quarantine handoff state.
- Explicit attachment trust presentation states: Verified, Unverified, Held and Blocked.
- Passive post-release text extraction for bounded UTF-8 plain text, Markdown and JSON with source-digest revalidation and private derived records.
- Read-only knowledge-eligibility assessment that reports security, extraction, Identity/application, Privacy Shield and downstream-stage gates while keeping indexing/retrieval/model-context execution disabled.
- Bounded non-persistent knowledge-authorization input assessment for supplied Identity/application context and current Privacy Shield decision structures.
- Application-local knowledge operation identifiers and strict actor/resource/operation/time/request/privacy binding.
- Explicit non-authority markers that prevent supplied authorization JSON from becoming production trust, persistent authorization or execution authority.
- Runtime-adapter readiness, evidence-envelope, replay-precondition and Development durable single-use/revocation registry foundations. These remain non-production trust scaffolding until authenticated producers and accepted adapters exist.

## Repository and verification foundations

- Root `USER-MANUAL.md` as the sole authoritative user manual under the GitHub-only manual-storage rule.
- Repository-native specification, benefits, competitive objectives, branding references and implementation documentation.
- Platform Contract 0.4 declaration evaluating all nine Integral Platform Systems with incomplete integrations represented as blocked/nonconformant rather than passed.
- Exact-head CI for TypeScript checking, server syntax, Node tests, production client build, Wardveil reference tests/contract validation and Python compilation.

## Material limitations

- The new routing components are not wired into the live backend chat route.
- Current Development API bearer handling is not final GoreeCloud Identity/application authorization.
- No authenticated production Wardveil scanner transport is connected.
- No authenticated production Identity, Privacy Shield or GoreeCloud Policy runtime adapter is accepted.
- Native RAG execution remains disabled; indexing, retrieval and model-context eligibility remain false.
- Current source/CI evidence does not prove real target-host GPU capacity, sustained throughput, all model capabilities, production deployment or Stable qualification.
